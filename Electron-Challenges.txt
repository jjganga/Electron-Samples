Issues faced on Electron:
=========================
1. jQuery not defined in Electron
	Solution	: Add the below 2 lines at first one and at last one line
					<script>if (typeof module === 'object') {window.module = module; module = undefined;}</script>
					<script>if (window.module) module = window.module;</script>

2. Opening a child window through window.open can not communicate with each other windows. Only way to communicate between the browser windows opened in Electron is throw main process threw IPC.

3. Loading the website with self signed certificate in Electron
	Detail		: Website which has self signed certificate will not be loaded in Chromium in Electron framework.
	Solution	: Use the below command to run "electron . --ignore-certificate-errors"

4. Packaging darwin build on Windows results in blocked folder (access denied)
	Detail		: Package is created successfully but not able to zip them or copy them. Not even read access. Windows throws "File not found or no read permission"
	Reference	: https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager/issues/164
	Solution	: Create the Mac build on Mac OSX only. :)

5. Debugging on Main process. electron-inspector is not working. Package is not available.

6. window.open from main process is not available. So we need to store the url in a text file and relaunch the app again with the new url(Environment changes, QA, QA1, app.kore.com).

7. Windows Installer - Bit confusion to understand about the windows squirrel events.

8. Network trace is not so easy
